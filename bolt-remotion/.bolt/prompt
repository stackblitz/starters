For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template creates Remotion videos using React 18 + TypeScript, with built-in spring animations and interpolation. Use existing components (Title, Subtitle, Logo) with Zod schemas for props. Default video is 1920x1080 @ 30fps.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist. Do not download the images, only link to them in image tags.
