# StackBlitz Starter Templates

## About this repository

StackBlitz uses Git repositories as the source of the __starter templates__ on [stackblitz.com](https://stackblitz.com). This repository contains the source code for several starter templates maintained by the StackBlitz team and community.

Some open-source projects maintain starter templates in their own repositories. For examples, see the [create-vite templates](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite) and the [`nuxt/starter` repository](https:github.com/nuxt/starter/tree/v3-stackblitz).

## Contributing to this repository

Contributions to this repository are welcome. We ask that contributors first open an issue before opening a pull request for non-trivial changes, such as:

1. Adding a new template.
2. Upgrading a template’s npm dependencies to new major versions.
3. Changing many files in an existing template (except for formatting or cosmetic changes).

__Please note:__ the presence of a starter template in this repository does not guarantee that this template will be included on stackblitz.com. The list of starter templates on stackblitz.com (pictured below) is currently hand-picked by the StackBlitz team.
